## 3. Communicating with Natural Language

  Learn voice user interface techniques that turn speech into text and vice versa. Build a speech recognition model using deep neural networks.

  *Projec:* Speech Recognizer
          Build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline. The model will convert raw audio into feature representations, which will then turn them into transcribed text.
